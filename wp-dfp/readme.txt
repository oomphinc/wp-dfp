A simple & intuitive interface for displaying Google ads on your WP site.

== Description ==

The WP DFP plugin for WordPress greatly simplifies the process of adding
Google ads to your WordPress website or blog by doing all of the heavy lifting
for you. Simply provide your DFP network code in the WP DFP settings screen,
define your ad slots and set some sizing rules. And, when you're ready to add
the slot to your site simply drop in a shortcode to your content or copy and
paste a simple PHP snippet into your theme template.

== Screenshots ==

1. Easily manage slots right from with your WordPress admin. Shortcodes and
PHP template tags can also be easily found from the "Ad Slots" menu.
2. Specify your responsive sizing rules right within the WordPress admin. WP DFP
uses an intuitive approach to determining appropriate ad sizes by measuring the
ad container's width **NOT** the browser viewport.
